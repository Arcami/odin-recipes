    <p>This poppy seed chicken casserole recipe is a wonderful dish. Very easy to make!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 sleeve buttery round crackers (such as Ritz®), crushed</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon poppy seeds, or more if desired</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken breasts into a large pot; cover with water and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to
            medium, cover, and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Drain; shred
            chicken with two forks.

        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix crackers, melted butter, and poppy seeds together in
            a large bowl until combined; set aside.

        </li>
        <li>Stir condensed soup and sour cream together in a medium bowl; pour 1/2 of the mixture into a 9-nch square
            baking dish. Add shredded chicken in an even layer; top with remaining soup mixture. Sprinkle with Cheddar
            cheese, then top with cracker mixture.

        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes.

        </li>
    </ol>
