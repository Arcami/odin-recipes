    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best French onion soup recipe I know. I have been making it for 30 years and it never fails to
        please. It makes an exquisite presentation too!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 large red onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 large sweet onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Stir in red onions, sweet onions, and salt. Cook, stirring
            frequently, until onions are caramelized and almost syrupy, about 35 minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Stir in chicken broth, beef broth, red wine, and Worcestershire sauce. Bundle parsley, thyme, and bay leaf
            with kitchen twine; add to the pot. Simmer over medium heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove
            and discard herb bundle. Reduce heat to low; stir in vinegar and season with salt and pepper. Cover soup and
            keep warm over low heat while you prepare the toast.

        </li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Arrange bread slices on
            a baking sheet and broil, turning once, until well toasted on both sides, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat;
            do not turn off the broiler.

        </li>
        <li>Arrange 4 large oven-safe bowls or crocks on a rimmed baking sheet. Fill each bowl 2/3 full with hot soup.
            Top each bowl with 1 slice of toasted bread, 2 slices Gruyère cheese, and 1/4 of the Asiago cheese. Sprinkle
            a little bit of paprika over the top of each one.

        </li>
        <li>Cook under the hot broiler until bubbly and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Cheese will cascade over the
            sides of the crock and form a beautifully melted crusty seal as it melts.

        </li>
    </ol>
